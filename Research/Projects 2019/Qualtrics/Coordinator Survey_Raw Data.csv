Seems more a convenience for NICHE and not members.  I was sorry that Roundtables and posters seem to be a source of disdain for some NICHE leaders - as nurses we want to share and not make the conference for PHD/DNP students.
Accounting/finance department needs some work - I had an issue with 2018 conference fees that were sent to an address that was incorrectly printed on the invoice and took hours of time to correct.  NICHE sent back the check then realized 1 year later that they sent the valid check and recharged us.  We paid it but I was embarrassed to have to bring it to our management once again. 
Eugenia Bachaleda is a great support for coordinators and I am very impressed that Catherine D'Amico answers questions in the Coordinator Corner. 
Webinar content this year is quite good.
I know LTC is a new focus for NICHE - as health systems focus more on the continuum of care, we need to care for all people throughout their healthcare journeys.  Still, don' t forget the hospital nurses who are the foundation of NICHE.

also, the LTP is very frustrating...we are currently being seen by NICHE as 3 separate hospitals even though we are one system with one Medicare number.

Also, we did have one coordinator step down from the role and we had to replace her- so we paid to have another nurse attend the LTP.
