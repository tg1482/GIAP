# **Nurses Improving Care for Healthsystem Elders**
## **Geriatric Institutional Assessment Profile Report - Graph Data**
### **October 2018 Cohort**
</center>

#### **`r name`**
**GIAP Overview**

The Geriatric Institutional Assessment Profile (GIAP) is a baseline assessment of nurses' knowledge, skills, attitudes and perceptions regarding care for older adults. The information generated from the GIAP is used to identify strengths and prioritize opportunities to improve nursing practice to support clinical excellence in the care of older adults.     

The GIAP (v.8) provides clinical leaders with information about nurses' perceptions regarding:     

* Knowledge to identify and manage the geriatric syndromes 
* Availability of specialized resource to care for older adults
* Age-friendly care planning and delivery 
* Organizational values regarding care of older adults 
* Unit environment to support NICHE program implementation
  

<center>
#### **Nurse Characteristics**
</center>

**Participants:** The data included in this report were collected between `r lubridate::month(min(giap$startDate), label=T)`-`r lubridate::year(min(giap$startDate))` and `r lubridate::month(max(giap$startDate), label=T)`-`r lubridate::year(max(giap$startDate))`.  A total of `r nrow(giap %>% filter(Hospital.Name==name))` nurses at `r name` provided complete data for the questions included in this report. The demographic characteristics for the participating nursing staff from `r name` are summarized in the following tables.

**This diagram depicts the extent to which the participating nurses are satisfied with their job.**

**Practice Environment**

This section of the GIAP focuses on nurses' perceptions of the nursing unit to support age-friendly care. A practice environment that supports the unique care needs of older adults is characterized by: 1) the availability of specialized equipment and professional expertise; 2) holistic and person-centered care planning and care delivery processes; and 3) organizational values that support age-friendly care by taking older adults' unique needs into account in the design and delivery of care. This section concludes with nurses' assessment of the time and priority that managers, and other clinical leaders, place on implementing changes to improve the care of older adults on their unit.

**Organizational Values to Support Age-Sensitive Care**

The following diagram illustrates nurses' perceptions regarding organizational values to provide nursing care tailored to the unique needs of older adults.

*(Note: These questions assess nurses' perceptions regarding barriers and the lack of specialized resources to care for older adults. For this diagram, higher levels of disagreement reflect nurses' perceptions that the organization values and supports care for older adults.)*
